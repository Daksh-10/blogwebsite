# Inspektor Gadget at KubeCon and Cloud Native Rejekts

The Inspektor Gadget team is excited to present the project’s latest enhancements and capabilities at KubeCon and Cloud Native Rejekts in London, England next week (March 30th – April 4th). KubeCon and Rejekts are great events that not only allow us to showcase the progress of the project, but more importantly, meet up with community members such as yourself! Below are the details of our presentations, and we look forward to seeing you in London.

## [Understanding and Debugging DNS in Kubernetes Clusters](https://cfp.cloud-native.rejekts.io/cloud-native-rejekts-europe-london-2025/talk/ANB7FS/)
In this talk, we will explore the journey of DNS requests across various components with Kubernetes/OS context. We will then move on to tools, starting with the CoreDNS log plugin, before delving into advanced tools like Hubble and Inspektor Gadget’s DNS gadget. By leveraging the power of eBPF, these tools provide deep insights, enabling efficient tracing and resolution of complex DNS problems.

- **Date:** March 31st  
- **Time:** 14:35 – 15:05 BST  
- **Location:** Cloud Native Rejekts, The Nash  

## [Project Pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/features-add-ons/experiences/#project-pavilion)
The team will be at the Project Pavilion at the Solutions Showcase at KubeCon all day on Wednesday! This is a great opportunity for you to swing by to say hello to our maintainers, ask questions, and even brainstorm around use cases for Inspektor Gadget.

- **Date:** April 2nd  
- **Time:** 10:45 – 19:45 BST  
- **Location:** Kiosk 22B, Level 1 | Solutions Showcase | Hall Entrances N8 – N9  

## [DNS Issues? Here’s how you can use open source tools to debug failed DNS requests in your AKS Cluster](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/azure-at-kubecon-europe-2025--london-uk---april-1-4/4394616)
DNS issues are not only frequently encountered by those using Kubernetes, but they are often challenging to solve as well. This 15-minute session will walk you through common DNS-related problems and show you how open source tools can help you diagnose and solve these issues so that you can make the most of your AKS cluster. We will feature the CoreDNS Log Plugin, Hubble, and Inspektor Gadget in this rapid-fire demo.

- **Date:** April 3rd  
- **Time:** 12:00 - 12:15 BST  
- **Location:** Microsoft Azure Booth N150, Level 1 | Solutions Showcase | Hall Entrances N8 – N9  

## [Contribfest – Kubernetes Observability Simplified: Build, Debug, and Monitor with Inspektor Gadget](https://kccnceu2025.sched.com/event/1tczR/contribfest-kubernetes-observability-simplified-build-debug-monitor-with-inspektor-gadget?iframe=no)
The session kicks off with an introduction to Inspektor Gadget, followed by hands-on guidance to set up your development environment (we’ll do most of the heavy lifting for you ahead of time). Participants will learn about the concept of "gadgets" and create their own simple "Hello World" gadget. From there, you can explore various ways to contribute, including developing new gadgets, enhancing existing gadgets, or collaborating to brainstorm innovative features.

- **Date:** April 3rd  
- **Time:** 14:15 – 15:30 BST  
- **Location:** Level 3 | ICC Capital Suite 17  

We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HbapduTjj9) to coordinate informal meetups at the conference. Feel free to drop a message there throughout the hallway track.

See you in London!
