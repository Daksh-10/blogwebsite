# Kubescape Reaches Incubation

Congratulations to our friends at [Kubescape](https://github.com/kubescape) for reaching incubation status. Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security project designed to offer comprehensive security coverage throughout the entire development and deployment lifecycle. Kubescape leverages eBPF via Inspektor Gadget for runtime observability and Open Policy Agent (OPA) for configuration scanning.
